## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt combining CSS Flexbox and Grid, using them simultaneously in this project.
- I learnt the importance of css variables and their usage.
- I learnt how to apply different style using Javascript DOM Manipulation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Relationship_of_grid_layout_with_other_layout_methods) - This helped me to understand the layout properties and how to style them individually and in relation to other layouts. I recommend it to anyone learning this concept.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grid.
